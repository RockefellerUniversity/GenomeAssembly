## Genome Assembly

In this exercise, we will practice attempt to assemble some genomes using the web interface Galaxy.

```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}

if(params$toMessage != "false"){

cat('For a detailed explanation of the exercises review the second session of the Genome Assembly course <a href="https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/GenomeAssembly/presentations/slides/Session2.html">here</a>.')
  
}

```

First of all you need to create a Galaxy account in the EU mirror https://usegalaxy.eu/.

## 1. Get the data

Now let's get started by downloading some HiFi data:

ecoli	SRR10971019
yeast	SRR13577846
fly		SRR10238607

Let's pick one (or all, but I suggest to start with ecoli) and in the tools search bar locate <i>Download and Extract Reads in FASTA/Q</i> (aka fastq-dump)
! there is also fasterq-dump, which however doesn't work with hifi.
! if you want to try the fly, make sure you download the reads as fastq (not fastq.gz).
! See below, I rather suggest starting from the simpler ecoli or yeast.

Select SRR accession and input one of the above IDs. 
Leave the other parameters unchanged and execute.

## 2. Run QC

Then we want to run some QC. In the tools search bar locate <i>FastQC</i>.
Note that you don't have to wait for the download (or any other job) to finish to plan the next step!

## 3. Assemble it

Now let's run <i>hifiasm</i> using the hifi reads we have downloaded (or are still downloading)
!note: if you wish to assemble the fly, the dataset is very large so we first need to downsample it.
First,run <i>Fastq to tabular</i> with default settings on the read set.
Then since the data set is 25.8Gbp (from 1,057,390 reads) the coverage is about 25.8/0.175=147x.
A typical hifi dataset is 30-40x so we can sample 2301518:147=x:35 -> 251759 reads to achieve the desidered coverage.
Use the tool <i>Select random lines</i> on the tabular output then convert it back to fastq with <i>Tabular to FASTQ</i> using:
Identifier column	1
Sequence column	2
Quality column	3
You can run <i>FastQC</i> again on the downsampled reads to make sure everything looks good.

## 4. Collect general genome metrics

While our assembly runs we can get some information on the genome parameters using kmers. 
Run <i>khmer: Abundance Distribution (all-in-one)</i> using the raw reads as input. Make sure in the advanced options you set:
kmer length = 21
tablesize = 1000000000

In Galaxy we can manipulate files relatively easily, let's use awk to convert the output of khmer to a format suitable for Genomescope2.
Search for <i>Text reformatting</i> (aka awk), select the output of khmer as input (the csv file), and type this as awk program:


```
{FS = ","; if($2!=0 && NR>1) printf $1" "$2"\n"}
```

Now you can download the results using the right bar. Then get to http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/genomescope2.0/
You only need to upload the file you just downloaded as input, make sure to select the appropriate ploidy and submit.

## 5. Let's evaluate the assembly

Use <i>GFA to FASTA</i> to convert both the primary and alternate assembly graphs to the more common fasta format.

Once you have generated the fasta you can run <i>Fasta Statistics</i> on both the primary and the alternate.
We could also <i>Compute sequence length</i> on the assembly and then generate an histogram <i></i>.

Now let's locate <i>Busco</i> (v4) and run it on both the primary and alternate assembly. 
Make sure you pick a reasonable classification for the species under consideration (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria for ecoli, Fungi for yeast, Insecta for the fly).

## 6. Compare!

Now let's download the Genbank reference assembly for the same species, repeat the evaluation steps and compare the numbers.

Let's also download some other genome that we are interested in, even larger ones, and run the evaluation steps on them.
For instance we can navigate to the fly reference genome:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001215.4
Now click on <i>FTP directory for RefSeq assembly</i> in the right menu.
Copy the link for the file named <i>GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.gz</i>
In Galaxy click on <i>upload data</i> and then <i>paste/fetch data</i>, then paste the link to the assembly.

Evaluate as many assemblies from different species as you like!
Set them up at the same time so that you can just go and relax for a few hours and wait for the results.
You can run fasta statistics and busco, but also genomescope on different raw data sets (illumina will work fine too).
We will discuss the results together.
